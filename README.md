## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

* **No ROMs Included**: MAME4droid is strictly an EMULATOR and DOES NOT INCLUDE ROMS or copyrighted material.
* **Not Affiliated with MAMEDev**: This project is independent of the official MAME team.
* **High-End Hardware Recommended**: Based on the latest PC MAME version, it requires high specifications. Modern games (90s+) may not run at full speed on all devices.
* **Support**: Due to the massive library of titles, support for specific individual games cannot be provided.

## 🚀 Performance & Hardware

While MAME is known for being demanding, this version includes modern optimizations for mobile hardware:

* **arm64 DRC (Dynamic Recompiler)**: Recent versions now feature a dedicated **64-bit ARMv8 recompiler (DRC)**. This provides a massive performance boost for complex systems (like Killer Instinct or CPS-3), allowing them to run much faster than in older, legacy emulators.
* **Requirements**: Despite these optimizations, a **high-end Android device** is still recommended for the most demanding 90s-era 3D arcade games to achieve full speed.

## 🛠️ Recommended Setup (External Storage)

For the best experience and to save internal storage, it is recommended to store your ROMs on external storage using Android's **Scoped Storage** system.

### First-Time Installation Guide
1.  **Prepare your external storage**: Create a folder named `MAME4droid` (or any name you prefer) on your SD card or internal memory.
2.  **Initial Launch**: Open the app for the first time.
3.  **Path Selection**: When asked "Where do you have stored or want to store your roms files?", select **EXTERNAL STORAGE**.
4.  **Grant Permission**:
    * The Android file picker will open. Navigate to your external storage, select the folder you created, and tap **"Use this folder"**.
    * Tap **Allow** to give MAME4droid permission to access that directory.
5.  **Romset Version**: Ensure you are using the **'0.284'** romset for compatibility.

*Note: If you already installed it, you can change the path in **Options > Settings > General > Change ROMs path**.*
